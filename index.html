                <h1>How to play</h1>
                <p>BombFlip is a game in wich you flip over cards to find numbers hidden beneath them.</p>
                <p>The cards are hiding the numbers 1 through 3... and bombs as well.</p>
                <p>The first number you flip over will give you that many points.</p>
                <p>From them on, the number you find will add to the total amount of points you've collected by 
                    that number.
                </p>
                <p>If it's a 2, your total will be increased by 2.</p>
                <p>If it's a 3, your total will be increased by 3.</p>
                <p>But if you flip over a 1, your total will stay the same. And if you flip over a bomb, 
                    it's game over.</p>
                <p>When that happens, you'll lose all the points you've collected in the corrent game.</p>
                <p>Once you've found all the hidden 2 and 3 cards, you've cleared the game and will advance to the 
                    next level of difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>As the difficulty increases, you will be able to receive more points. Do your best!</p>
                <br>
                <p>The numbers at the side of the board will give you a clue about the numbers hidden on the back 
                    of the panels.</p>
                <p>The larger the number, the more likely it is that there are many large numbers hidden in that 
                    row or column.</p>
                <p>In the same way, you can tell how many bombs are hidden in the row or column.</p>
                <p>Consider the hidden number totals and the bombs totals carefully as you flip over panels.</p>
